This is a new advertising project I recently worked on, but was taken off the server due to new latest modern design. Almost everything is complete in this project just the Ipad/tablet sizes are not resposnive at some points.

You can not use any of the linked images in this project, else you can modify this project as per your need.

This project could also be easily coverted to SCSS instead of css, every section has its own separate id's and classes and you can easily segregate this as per SCSS requirements.

Below is the screenshot of the homepage of the website.
